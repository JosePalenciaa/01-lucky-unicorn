# Asks users for a number (string)
# get_number = int(input("Choose a number: "))
# Correct way would be to ask for an integer int()

# Multiplies the number by 5
# final_number = get_number * 5

# Outputs the result
# print(final_number)

# This does not work, instead it just prints the number 5 times.

# With print statement:

get_number = int(input(" Choose a number: "))
final_number = get_number * 5
print(" {} times 5 is equal to {}".format(get_number, final_number))
